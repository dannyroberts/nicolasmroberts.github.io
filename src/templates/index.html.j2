        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>
                I am a PhD Candidate at <em> The University of Wisconsin--Madison</em>, working with <a href="http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/people/faculty/basil-tikoff/"> Basil Tikoff</a>. I've spent most of that time working on a large granitic dome in the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia, the Mt Edgar granitic complex. The geodynamics that drove the construction of earth's Earliest continents (that's right, the Pilbara craton has rocks as old as 3.6 billion years old) is a matter of ongoing debate--was plate tectonics already operating at a global scale, or did these early continents form in some pre-plate tectonics context?
        </p>
        <p>
                But I have also spent a lot of time working on the statistical treatment of high-dimensional structural geology data (like foliation-lineation pairs, strain ellipsoids). Structural geology is on the edge of a very exciting time--we are transitioning from using almost exclusively small field datasets........etc.
